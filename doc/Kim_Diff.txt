Differences between Kilo and KIM (KIm)


KIM is a modified version of Snaptokens Editor project, which is
a modified version of Kilo - a text editor written in C.

At the time of writing this (2022-2023), the Snaptoken version
has received many fixes that have paved the way for the KIM 
project to be started in order to create an even more functional
editor on top of that, as it is the only genuinely functional
version of the editor.


1. Syntax Highlighting:
	- Moved syntax highlighting database to "syntax.c & syntax.h"
	- Expanded syntax highlighting to support more languages
	- Added more keywords to highlight
	- Introduced highlighting for binary / hexadecimal literals
	- Added multi-line strings with in-string escapes (", ', `)
	- Implemented in-string highlighting (escapes / formats)
	- Updated search to show not one, but all results in every line
	- Syntax highlighting may also be changed / disabled anytime

2. Terminal Interface: 
	- Improved terminal interaction, clear screen and scrollback
	- Added SIGWINCH signal handler to resize the editor
	- Added command line arguments for basic information 
	- Implemented line deletion functionality (single / multiple)
	- Added mouse scrolling for ST, see ".kimrc" for line traversal
	- Introduced search and replace functionality
	- A dynamic copy / paste buffer has been implemented
	- Added jump to line feature

3. File Interaction:

6. Configuration Management:
	- The ".kimrc" config may now be used to configure the editor
	- If KIM cannot find it in /etc, it will use defaults
	- KIM highlights the config based on settings categories
	- Config values are subject to sanity checks, reset if needed

7. Hardware Interaction:
	- Fixed the existing memory leaks (Valgrind: still reachable)

8. Project Structure:
	- Fully modularized the codebase
